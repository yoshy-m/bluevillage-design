        <p class="element">The snow has melted away and Hokkaido is in the season of fresh green leaves. We will hold a primitive camp that touches the most fundamental life of us human beings.</p>
        <p class="element">Completely removed from modern technology such as cell phones and computers. We make a fire with flint, eat simple meals, and sleep on beds made of certain things.</p>
        <p class="element">During the camp, we will also do some introspection work based on Native American wisdom. You will connect deeply with your inner self and share it with your fellow campers, creating new bonds.</p>
        <p class="element">For those who are seeking a deeper connection with nature, for those who are at a turning point in their lives, for those who are seeking a deeper connection with nature, for those who are seeking a deeper connection with nature. <br>
          If you are looking for a real sense of life, spend 3 days and 2 nights at this camp. We hope you will gain a new vision of life and a new sense of "living".</p>

          <h3 class="ttl">Message from New Day Douglas, Organizer</h3>
          <p>Greetings from the forest and lakeshore of Toyako!<br>
            I’m Doug, and we at NewDay and Blue Village are passionate about giving everyone an unforgettable experience of a lifetime. Please don’t miss this opportunity with us to discover Nature with new eyes, on an inner journey of growth in awareness, belonging, and connection. Our aim is to truly enjoy this time with an energetic, relaxing, and transformative approach. Every aspect of this unique camp has been created and improved with over 40 years of experience in the wild, to give us a fresh perspective of Nature and ourselves thru an immersion in simplicity and gratitude. We’re likely to be more challenged mentally than physically, so this amount of time in such beauty with our new friends becoming like family is guaranteed to be very empowering. These gifts will also flow into our inner strength and confidence which impacts all areas of our lives. There are more risks in daily city life, however all precautions will be implemented to ensure our safety.<br>
            Just as we will share our many stories together, please feel free to contact us anytime with any questions or concerns. Thanks and see you here!<br>
            &quot;May the Great Mystery make sunrise in your heart.&quot; -Sioux prayer

          <p>I met Doug last winter. I attended a workshop he organized for adults, where we played like kids in the forest and he taught us how to make a "debris hut," a simple dwelling made of only dead leaves and twigs.<br>
            By some fortunate coincidence, we lived very close to each other, and we began to talk about many things over a beer or dinner together. This camp project is the realization of one of the visions that emerged from these moments at the dinner table. Doug and I are about the same age as father and son, but I think we share one underlying wish. We want the earth to remain beautiful and blue, and we want to do what we can to support it. I am very happy to be able to work with him in creating this camp, and I am looking forward to seeing what kind of time we will have together.</p>

He traveled to more than 40 countries, including Mongolia, New Zealand, and Peru, and continued to explore his inner world by participating in various programs, and the vision for Blue Village came down to him when he first came to Lake Toya in 2016. He then found a piece of land with a water spring in the forest by Lake Toya and started building a hut with his friends; in early 2020, he sold his business in Tokyo and moved completely to Lake Toya.<br>
            Currently working as a hypnotherapist, a guide to the inner world, and creating a forest where people can connect with their soul's desire and express it freely.</p>

            <p>Born in 1987. After graduating from Tama Art University with a BFA in oil painting, he joined TeamLab Inc. After becoming independent, began working as an artist.<br>
            Through his experiences with shaman ceremonies in Peru and Native American rites of passage in Sweden, he became interested in depth psychology, quantum theory, astronomy, and folklore. Based on these experiences, he has been questioning, through various media such as abstract paintings and workshops, the boundaries between the visible and invisible, between the conscious and unconscious, and between the self and others, as well as the ambiguous and invisible phenomena in the world.</p>
